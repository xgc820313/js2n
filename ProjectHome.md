JS2N (JavaScript to Native) is a cross platform project that enables safely accessing native operating system resources (such as sockets, files, databases etc.) from within a Web page in a Web browser.

The project consists of a framework to interface the native OS from the browser (using ActiveX on IE and NPAPI on other browsers), plugin extensions that can expand the framework to support various native OS resources and JavaScript class wrappers for easy access to these resources.
